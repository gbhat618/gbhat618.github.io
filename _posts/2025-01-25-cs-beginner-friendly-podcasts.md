**[Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-1)**

A few years ago I discovered about the Command Line Heroes podcast by Redhat, Saron Yitbarek narrates various computer historical stories in such an engaging way. I learnt so many things about the history of computing by listening to this podcast (and of course it's joy listening to Saron's captivating voice).

**[Base.cs](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)**

Another beginner friendly podcast (co-hosted by Saron Yitbarek again) Base.cs where basic topics of CS like:

- [Bits, Binary, and Bytes](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/3)
- [A heap of heaps](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/42)
- and a lot more (as there are 9 seasons in here too)

**For inspirational stories** of passionate people, or overcoming struggles in learning to code:

- [CodeNewbie Podcast Stories from people on their coding journey](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)
- [freeCodeCamp podcast](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/podcast/)

I find them useful to, broaden my percepective, optimizing learning new things, just inspiring, and of course relaxing.

**More**

There is a whole sea of podcasts discussing topics in CS and Software Engineering, one such collection is [rShetty/awesome-podcasts](https://github.com/rShetty/awesome-podcasts).

**Listen on AntennaPod**

I prefer apps that only play Podcasts (not the ones like Spotify or YT Music which are hybrid for music and podcast); intially I used Castbox but it seemed a bit heavy, and I settled on Google Podcasts for it's simplicity - but google discontinued this app and integrated that into YT Music.

Then I found [AntennaPod â€“ The Open Podcast Player](https://antennapod.org/) (available in Playstore too), it's simple, ad-free and just works... I guess I would have used it all along if only I knew it from the beginning.
